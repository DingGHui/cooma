Design Principle
=========================

- Simple(readability)
- Concept Independence
- Developer Friendly

Origin
=========================

I'm one developer of the dubbo project, and I maintain the microcontainer part of dubbo. The microcontainer of dubbo is good, but the concept is dependent to dubbo, and too complex. I think this is a bad smell for reusability, so I cramp out the code of microcontainer part from the dubbo, and name it to cooma.
